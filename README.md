# Welcome to my Journal

This is intended to be a place where I can document things that I learn. Everyone is more than welcome to read and use
everything this journal contains. Just be aware that I am not responsible for any damage any script may cause son your
system.

I should note that while I hope this journal is useful to others, I am the main target audience. So there may be some
inside jokes or non-standard words (ex klonk yoink) that might not make sense to most users, but I hope they don't harm
the readability too much.

Note that this is not intended to be a 100% up-to-date reference on every topic that is listed, so use the info that you
find with care

## Format

Alongside this README you should find directories containing at least a `README.md`, but no other files or directories
are required. See below for a list of standard file and directory names inside each topic directory. If you are

## Linting

This journal lints the markdown files with [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint). To make
contributing easier for you, I've added some useful git hooks under the `hooks` directory. To utilize them simply copy
or link them into the `.git/hooks` directory:

```shell
ln --symbolic hooks/* .git/hooks
```
